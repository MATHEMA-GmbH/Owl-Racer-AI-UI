The UI client is a visual test and sandbox client implemented with the MonoGame framework. MonoGame is based on Microsofts XNA framework and enables fast and lightweight 2D rendering perfectly suited for the purpose of showing the user what is going on during machine learning. It also enables the users to drive a car themselves and even compete against AI.

Note however, that the UI client is merely a tool to give developers a visual representation to make analysis easier (ok, and to incorporate some fun into the project ^^). The focus still relies on the machine learning clients doing the actually interesting stuff.

The communication between the UI client and the server is realized using a (Web-)gRPC channel.

The UI currently supports Resolutions above 1920 x 1200.
